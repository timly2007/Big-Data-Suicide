-- Information --

Big Data: Suicide is a informal project that aims to predict the number of suicides annually per 100k population in a group of people based off of a couple of factors:
age, gender, HDI, and GDP per capita. None of this information should be used in serious scenarios and is purely for learning about Big Data Analytics. In this project,
multiple prediction algorithms were tested but only the Random Forest Algorithm is on this page as it has the highest accuracy, with a mean percentage error of 13%. 

If you are looking to improve this suicide predictor, here are a couple of things you may want to find:
        - Other Variables (e.g. climate, population density, access to technology, etc.)
        - Better Prediction Models
        - Larger Datasets

-- How to Use --

1. Download "Predictor Code.py," "Final Data Set - Big Data Project.csv," and "testing_data.csv" into the same folder.
2. Make sure you have python installed on your device with the libraries pandas and sklearn.
3. Open "testing_data.csv" and input values for the four variables age, sex, HDI, and GDP per capita while leaving the first column blank.
4. Run "Predictor Code.py" for a prediction for the annual suicide rate per 100k population.
5. If you would like to predict a suicide rate with a subset of the four variables, delete the undesired variable columns on both sheets and perform steps 3-4.
